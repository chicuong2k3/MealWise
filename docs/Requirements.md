## Technical Requirements

Technical requirements describe the technical aspects and issues that need to be addressed for the project or software to work and execute successfully. These aspects include performance concerns, reliability, and accessibility. Essentially, technical requirements serve as solutions to technical issues.

### Performance
- Optimize for fast loading times, especially on mobile devices.
- Ensure smooth interactions, even with complex data inputs like ingredient lists or meal filters.

### Reliability
- Ensure the app remains stable during meal suggestions and data input processes.
- Handle network interruptions gracefully, particularly for offline mode.
- Include error handling for invalid user inputs or missing data.

### Accessibility
- Create a responsive and mobile-friendly UI to accommodate various devices.
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) for visually impaired users.

### Scalability
- Design the architecture to support additional features in the future (e.g., user-generated recipes).
- Ensure the database can handle increased data as the user base grows.

### Data Handling
- Store user preferences, favorites, and meal data locally using IndexedDB or SQLite for offline use.
- Sync data to the backend when online to provide a seamless experience.

### Security
- Use encryption for storing sensitive user data.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Secure API endpoints and ensure data integrity during communication.

### Deployment
- Host on a reliable cloud platform like Azure or AWS for scalability and uptime.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Support PWA (Progressive Web App) features to allow installation and offline functionality.

### Integration
- Optionally integrate with third-party APIs for real-time ingredient pricing.
- Enable future support for community recipe sharing through external platforms or APIs.
